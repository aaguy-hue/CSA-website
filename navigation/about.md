# About Me
Hello there, my name is Aadit Mathur. Yes indeed, it is me. The one and only me.

I am the son of two Indian immigrants. My father came to the US for a better education, and when my mother was engaged, she also came here to do her master's degree. I've always had to juggle the two cultures and incorporate both into my life. There's a common term used as a joke in the Indian-American community: ABCD, or American-Born Confused Desi. This term fits me perfectly, whether it be in matters of religion, food, or anything else.
