# About Me
Hello there, my name is Aadit Mathur. Yes indeed, it is me. The one and only me.

I am the son of two Indian immigrants. My father came to the US for a better education, and when my mother was engaged, she also came here to do her master's degree. 

😕 I've always had to juggle the two cultures and incorporate both into my life. There's a common term used as a joke in the Indian-American community: ABCD, or American-Born Confused Desi. This term fits me perfectly, whether it be in matters of religion, food, or anything else.

## CS-related activities throughout high school
I've been interested in computer science for a long time, but for the sake of brevity, I will restrict this section to major things in high school.

- 🕹️ Made a platformer for the Gameboy using assembly
- 🤖 Made software for robots for the FIRST Tech Challenge (software lead of team Runtime Terror)
- 🧑‍💻 Made a platform to easily host CTFs (a type of cybersecurity competition)
- 💀 Created various Discord bots, some of which were used by hundreds of people
- 🎮 Created a python library for game development
- 🏫 Studied at Carneggie Mellon University's Pre-College Program in Computational Biology
