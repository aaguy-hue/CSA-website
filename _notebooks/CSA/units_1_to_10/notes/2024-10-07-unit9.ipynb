    "### Keywords\n",
    "- `super` keyword: it's like the `this` keyword, except it accesses the superclass instead of the current class\n",
    "- `@Override` annotation: specifies that a method overrides a method in the superclass (technically not needed but good for readability)\n",
    "  - `final` methods can't be overridden\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocab\n",
    "- **Superclass / Parent Class**: Class that has common fields and methods shared by subclasses\n",
    "- **Subclass / Child Class**: Class that extends functionality of the superclass (does not inherit constructors)\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: The ability to treat objects of different classes through a common interface, allowing for method overriding\n",
    "- Static vs dynamic types\n",
    "  - **Static types**: The type of the variable you declare at compile time (when you say `Animal bozo`, Animal is the static type)\n",
    "  - **Dynamic types**: The type of the variable at runtime (when you say `= new Monkey()`, monkey is the dynamic type)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polymorphism/polymorphic/etc\n",
    "- **Polymorphic** reference variables can refer to objects of different classes in the code\n",
    "- **Polymorphic** methods are overriden in at least one subclass\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: act of executing overriden non-static method at runtime based on the actual object type"
